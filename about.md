Hi, my name is **Vitor Bittencourt**. I'm a webdeveloper and this blog is mostly about
my open source contributions.

I currently work as a Ruby on Rails/Frontend developer at [Hotel Urbano](http://www.hotelurbano.com/).

You can find me on the channels right there on the footer. Be sure to
say hello.
